IT = Information Technology
WUfB = Windows Update for Business
Intune = Microsoft Endpoint Manager (also known as Intune) which is a mobile device management solutions
AD = Active Directory
SCRAM = PostgreSQL10 introduced SCRAM (Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism) to securely authenticate passwords. 
TLS = Transport Layer Security
SSL = Secure Socket Layer
PBKDF2 = Password-based Key Derivation Function 2
MAC = Message Authentication Code
HMAC = In cryptography, an HMAC is a specific type of message authentication code (MAC) involving a cryptographic hash function and a secret cryptographic key.
MITM = Man-in-the-middle attack, in cryptography and computer security, a man-in-the-middle, monster-in-the-middle, machine-in-the-middle, monkey-in-the-middle, meddler-in-the-middle, manipulator-in-the-middle (MITM), person-in-the-middle (PITM) or adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) attack is a cyberattack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communications between two parties who believe that they are directly communicating with each other, as the attacker has inserted themselves between the two parties.
NONCE = Number Once, in cryptography, a nonce is an arbitrary number that can be used just once in a cryptographic communication.[1] It is often a random or pseudo-random number issued in an authentication protocol to ensure that old communications cannot be reused in replay attacks. They can also be useful as initialization vectors and in cryptographic hash functions.
OID = Object identifiers (OIDs) are used internally by PostgreSQL as primary keys for various system tables. Type oid represents an object identifier.
